    <h1 style="text-align:center;">My Upbringing </h1>
   <p style="text-align:center;"> Hi my name is Matt and back when I was a just a young a lad I was an amazing soccer player! 
    I kicked a lot of balls, ran a lot of miles, and drank a lot of gatorade! I was living the life!
    It all started when my best friend invited me to tryouts for his club team. Until this point I was just a typical recreational player only there for the snacks!
    However, my friend convinced me to tryout so I went! I didn't know this at the time but I SUCKED!! After tryouts I didn't make the team but I didn't know that nor did I care.
    I just kept going to practice with my friend and eventually one day my coach pulled me aside and said "You know Matt you never made the team..." Now I'm 13 years old so I said "oh ok" and that was it. 
    My coach continued "...but you've shown me a good work ethic and quick improvements so I'd like to offer you a spot on the team". And the rest is history.

<h2 style="text-align:center;" id="DearGus">Dear Gus</h2>
 <p style="text-align:center;">   My best friends grandpa would always drive us to and from our games and practices so we gave him the name of "Gus The Bus Driver" 
    I truly owe my success to Gus he was always there for me! He bought me food which helped me to grow tall and skinny. He cheered me on 
    He showed me music like the exploding hearts. To be quite honest they scared me sometimes but Gus's soothing voice made me feel safe. 
    Gus you're the greatest fake grandpa I ever did have! I hope someday you will forgive me for spilling hot chocolate on your seat :)
